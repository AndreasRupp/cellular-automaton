# How to use cellular-automaton / CAM

This will be your job when everything works, Simon and Joona.

Currently, run `g++ -std=gnu++20 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fstack-protector-all -g -Iinclude 
cam_test.cxx -o test; ./test` or `clang++-12 -std=gnu++20 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic 
-fstack-protector-all -g -Iinclude cam_test.cxx -o test; ./test`
